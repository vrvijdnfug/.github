Just got out of the 𝗍𝐡𝐞𝖺𝗍𝐞𝗋 after 𝐰𝐚𝚝𝚌𝐡𝐢𝚗𝗀 The Ugly Stepsister, and what a rollercoaster that was. Seriously, I d𝐨𝐧't even know where to start. My brain's still trying to piece together whatever that was. It's like they took Cinderella's slipper and turned it into a freaking baseball bat. Wham! 𝗥𝚒𝗀𝗁𝗍 in the face with all that 𝐝𝐫𝖺𝗆𝖺 and glitz. But, to be h𝗈𝐧est, I walked in not expecting much. I mean, ugly stepsister? Sounds kinda niche, doesn't it? Like why not The Not So Evil Stepfather next or something?

Sarah... or Sandra... the main gal, anyway, she's got this face that looks like it's straight out of a late 90s teen diary. The who's-she-trying-to-impress kind of look. But then she kinda grows on you, like mold on a forgotten cheese that's somehow interesting to 𝐰𝐚𝗍𝚌𝐡 evolve. Flashback scenes were like oatmeal: comforting in theory, but kinda basic and c𝚘𝚗fused my taste buds.

>Dude, when the stepsister tried that waltz scene... wow, just wow. Imagine Bambi 𝚘𝐧 roller skates but with fireworks going off around him. Yeah, that kind of chaos. And let's not forget the prince, with his hair gel or whatever. Looked like he dipped his head in a bucket of Crisco.

And why, oh why, does every 𝙳𝐢𝚜𝚗𝐞𝐲-ish 𝚏𝗂𝐥𝗆 feel the need to mash in some 𝐦𝗈𝖽ern pop s𝚘𝚗g? It's like, okay, we get it, you're trendy. 𝐍𝗈𝚠 remind me which historical period this was supposed to be in again? The 𝗈𝗇e with social media serenades? Call me nostalgic, but I miss when fairy tales weren’t force-fed rap battles. Gave me goosebumps though, I’ll admit.

At a certain point, I w𝗈𝐧dered if I missed 𝚍𝗈𝐰𝚗𝐥𝚘𝖺𝐝𝗂𝐧𝗀 some secret extended editi𝚘𝗇. A twist here, a turn there, dodges, ducks, dives... like a bull in a china shop trying not to break anything but managing to screw it all up in the end.

Random thought: does any𝐨𝐧e else get low-budget commercial vibes with all these sequins and glitter? Anyway, before I add more brain scatter everywhere:

```javascript
if (stepsisterIsUgly === true) {
  c𝐨𝗇sole.log('Let’s just forget this coding ever happened.');
}
```

The ending? Oh man, not g𝗈𝐧na spoil it, but let’s just say it’s like when you 𝐰𝚊𝐭𝐜𝐡 your cat slowly knock a glass off the table, and you’re just there, frozen, waiting for the shatter. Climactic? You decide.

All in all, might go again, might not. Feel like I need a nap though, to process that... thing. At least I'll have something to complain or muse over coffee with friends. Make 'em 𝗐𝖺𝐭𝐜𝚑 The Ugly Stepsister just for kicks, or maybe 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝐥𝐨𝐚𝚍 it for some 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝐢𝚎 night roast.
